Good afternoon.
This is a tutorial on how the Medical Encyclopedia works, created by María Iglesias for the Biomedical Engineering course.

The website starts with an index page that features two main articles. The first one is linked to another page and redirects automatically. The second one works the same way.

Just below, there is a visual map about atherosclerosis. Next, you’ll find the documents created in the previous assignment, related to the PAC evaluation. You can also access the Word files.

Further down, there is a link that redirects to an HTML page, where you can fill out a contact form. The first two fields of the form are required in order to submit it.

Then, there is a link where you can leave feedback about the accessibility of the website.

At the top of the page, there is a search bar. By clicking on it, you can search for diseases based on their symptoms. There is also a letter bar, where each letter is linked to diseases that start with that letter.

In this video, two diseases are shown as examples: asthma and autism. By clicking on them, you are redirected to their respective articles, which include videos and related content. Some letters are not linked to any disease.

The website also offers different light modes and is accessible in terms of images and tables.

However, this explanation only covers the basic features.

Thank you and see you soon.
